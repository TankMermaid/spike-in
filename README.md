## File Structure 

- fig for all the corresponding main and supplementary figures 
- data for all the intermediate results such as OTU table and Tax annotation information, we run the Unoise and Usearch pipeline and based on this for downstream analysis, Our conclusion main focus the common trend to suggest the  underlying pattern with the quantitative method
- table for containing the main output results
- mockCommunity, perturbation, droughtWetRice, rootInfectedWheat aiming mainly for the hi-QAP calibrated table and scripts respectively
- statistics for including the main statistical analysis such as Hypothesis Testing and Differential Analysis and Non-parametric PerMANOVA 
- md5Sum for including all the md5sum file to make it convenient for usage of our Amplicon and Metagenome data in this experiment submitted to GSA in China
- index.Rmd for recapitulating the main figures and tables related to this project when in Rstudio using Knitr to output the index.html for results visulizing
