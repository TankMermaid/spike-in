# Spike-in-based quantitative abundance profiling (Si-QAP)

To assess the total microbial load and the abundance of individual microbes relative to the amount of host plant tissue, in this project, we established a spike-in-based quantitative abundance profiling (Si-QAP) workflow to accurately examine the total microbial load and colonization of individual root microbiome members relative to plant root DNA.
